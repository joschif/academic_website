I'm currently (still) a PhD candidate at the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering at ETH Zürich in the Lab of Barbara Treutlein.

My current work focuses in deciphering the gene regulatory logic of cell fate decisions in brain organoids.
For this, I am using a wide range of statistical and machine learning methods, primarily on single-cell (multi-)omics data. I also like to build computational tools for single-cell genomics.

I'm excited about moving towards predictive biology!

Here's my {{< staticref "uploads/cv.pdf" "newtab" >}}CV{{< /staticref >}}.
